<h2>Welcome to dymensional.nl, I hope you enjoy your stay!</h2>

<p>This website was made to showcase the Leeuwenhoek open-source 3D printer project. Feel free to scroll down for more information. </p>

<p>If you are interested in building your own, check out my build documentation with links to all the files you need!</p>

<h2>About the Leeuwenhoek</h2>

<p>All this started as a personal project. I needed a 3D printer that could move with me, and be compact enough to fit in my locker at the TU Delft.
I could not find a printer that truly fit my needs, so on August 2014 I started designing my own. My first working printer quickly gained popularity and was displayed at the university library’s 3D printing expo, at which point I decided to make it an open source project and finish the design nicely.</p>

<p>It needed a name, so because of its “place of birth” and compact design features, I only found it fitting to name it after none other but the father of microbiology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a fascinating 17-18th century biologist and tradesman from Delft!</p>

<p>Fast forward to march 2015. The design has been brought up to a quality worthy of releasing. Many people wished to buy it, so I decided to start my own business; Dymensional. </p>

<p>Don’t worry though, all my future work on this and other projects will continue to be open-source.</p>

<h2>Awesome Design Features:</h2>

<p>Dutch design: as much of the design as possible comes from the Netherlands. I also chose to use the high quality minitronics board by reprapworld as standard. I know you’ll love it.
